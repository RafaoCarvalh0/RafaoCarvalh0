Elixir has been my go-to language for most projects — I have 3+ years of professional and casual experience with it.
Recently, however, Go has been proving itself a strong contender for the top spot. I’ve paused my Elixir studies to dive into Go, exploring its ecosystem through hands-on projects and focused learning.
Most importantly, I’m genuinely enjoying the process.
<p/>
I appreciate working on personal projects — whether solo or with friends from different tech backgrounds — and I'm always looking for ways to improve as a developer. Whenever possible, I like to collaborate on meaningful or just fun and casual projects.
<p/>
So, feel free to reach out for a chat (or interesting proposals :upside_down_face:):  
<p/>
