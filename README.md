# Hello There. :beers:

#### My name is Rafael Carvalho. <img align="right" src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/476/072/9f5.gif" width="40%" style="max-width:100%;">

#### I currently live in Monte Alto (SP), Brazil  
#### I'm fueled by coffee and heavy metal... lots of heavy metal :skull:... and coffee :coffee:

<br/>Currently focused on learning Go. I'm diving into the language and exploring its ecosystem through hands-on projects and study.
<br/>I have 3+ years of professional experience with Elixir, working on real-world systems.
<br/>I enjoy working on personal projects — whether solo or with friends from different tech backgrounds — and I'm always looking for ways to improve as a developer. Whenever possible, I like to collaborate on meaningful or fun projects.

<br/>Feel free to reach out for a chat (or interesting proposals :upside_down_face:):
