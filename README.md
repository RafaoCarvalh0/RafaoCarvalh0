# Hello There. :beers:

***

<br/>Currently focused on Elixir and on a long journey to specialize as a backend developer. I enjoy working on personal projects, either solo or with my backender/frontender/someender friends.  
<br/>Like most people, I’m always looking to improve my programming skills, so I’m open to help and collaborate on projects when I have availability.

<br/>Feel free to reach out for a chat (or interesting proposals :upside_down_face:):
